The new smartphone has it all: A gorgeous design, a great camera, smooth performance, and good battery life, but its price is more expensive than the same products. Its design is very compact and luxurious. I think it’s durable however, it is only available in black colour and no other colour version. It has a rectangular shape and the screen size is 5.2 inches. In my opinion, its camera is not as good as those of other phones so the image quality isn't sharp. With battery life, its life is low. For example, with a capacity of 2,600mAh. When we use the app, the battery time only lasts for 5 hours. It can store up to 32 GB along with excellent and fast processor. I think about the pros. The touchscreen is smooth, sharp and speedy. The design is simple but impressive. In comparison with other phones at the same price, the camera seems to be the weakness so the image quality isn't good. To improve this product, you should recheck the battery to increase its lifespan. I recommend you check the camera to sharpen the image.
