When you create a new technology product or software, you should register copyright. The files that you need to have been the application form with the owner’s signature, certified copies of identity card/ passport of the owner, original works and some other necessary document. The copyright office of Vietnam is the place of registration because it is the agency responsible for copyright. There are many steps to make a copyright registration. First, you fill in the registration application form. Next, you file the application form with fee. You need to wait for 30 days for the agency to review and recognize copyright for you. The official fees for registration of copyrights depends on the specific work type. I think copyright registration is very important to protect our right and intellectual property.
