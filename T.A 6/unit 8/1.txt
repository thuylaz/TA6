       I graduated from Hanoi University of Industry and majored in software engineering. I have taken part in a job interview recently for the position of a tester at Samsung. I was interviewed by human resources’ manager. At the beginning of the interview, he asked me some questions about name, educational background and personalities. He also questioned me the reason why I applied for the job. I answered all the questions quickly and confidently because I prepared a very detailed job application. However, I feel nervous because my eyes contact was not good, my body languages was not positively. Finally, we discuss the working environment and remuneration packages. I waited for a week to receive the results but I did not receive an email from the company. I failed in this interview. I think that want a successful interview you should get ready ahead of time, try to stay calm, follow up after the interview... I hope I will have a better job interview for the next time.
