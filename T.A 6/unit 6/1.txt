       I am a junior at Hanoi University of Industry and my major is software engineering. My future job option is a webmaster. My job is responsible for creating the HTML code and directly manage the components of the website. To become a webmaster, after graduating I must have a good degree in software engineering. Besides, I should learn web design, HTML language or other programming languages to apply for the job. Moreover, I must have skills in business, marketing, graphic design and always update new technologies to apply to my work. Most importantly, every company has its own rules of work. Personally, I need to respect the ownership, privacy of others and be honest at work. In particular, I may not copy copyright and cheat at work. In short, I will try to achieve the highest performance.
