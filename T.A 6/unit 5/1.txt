      Customer service is an important tool to compete effectively, and professional customer care will bring a huge source of revenue. Therefore, customer support procedures through the telephone of a support technician are necessary. Firstly, when you receive a call from a customer give the greeting and identify yourself such as "Hello. This is Trung from ABC company. I'm a support technician. How can I help you?". Secondly, you have to listen to the customer's inquiry request or complaint. Then, collect necessary information like name, specifics of problems with some questions such as "May I have...? Can you give me...?". After that, you need to repeat the problems and get confirmation to ensure correct understanding. Next, you should apologize to the customer if the problem is caused by you, your company, or your product/service. You should express sympathy and reassure that you should send an on-site technician to the customer's home to resolve the problem. Finally, confirm that issue will be resolved to the customer's satisfaction.
